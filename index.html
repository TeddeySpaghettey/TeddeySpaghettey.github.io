        <p>Hey, it's me, Jesse! I'm sorry for being so bad at posting lately. I've been reaally busy with my classes! Today I read a news story about some kind of disease spreading down in South America. It's making people go nuts apparently. Ooo ~ Apocalypse? And by nuts I mean literally nuts. They're attacking people and some people actually got hurt before the police arrived. The news said that it was under control, though, so I don't feel like it's anything to worry about. It's still kind of freaky tho, isn't it? I bet Kevin is going nuts over it. As much as I love my conspiracy-craze of a roommate, at this point, I wouldn't be surprised to find him leaving the house in a tin-foil hat, LOL.
Still!! I love apocalypse movies, so I think that If I tried I would survive, to be honest. I have a lot of things at home that could work for barricading and my roommate Kevin love doing all kinds of conspiracy theories. Sometimes it gets a bit crazy-level but as long as he isn't wearing tin foil hats, right? Do you think you would survive the apocalypse?
<p> xo Jesse </p>

<p> I got the job!! You remember that pet store I was talking about last month? They got an opening a while back and I'm working there now! I'm so excited and thank you so much for your support! I can't believe it. I've wanted to work in a pet store since I was a kid and now it's finally happening!! I'm so glad for the tips you gave me on how to deal with nervousness and to do well at the interview. And I'm so sorry for not telling you how it went until now, but I really wanted to be sure that it was final before making it official. If you take a look at my Instagram you can see the address if you want to visit me there and get something for your cat or dog! :) Love you guys!!
<p>xo Jesse</p>

   <h5>8th of August, 2022</h5> 
   <p> We're having a sleepover!</p>
   <p>Lin is coming to America! She's my best friend and visiting me for two whole weeks! Not gonna lie, I've missed her super-much. We have so many things planned out! We're visiting the mall. She's definitely trying my fav candies! I'll have to use Kevin a bit, tho. Despite being here for a year, I've still barely seen half the town, LOL. I guess Kevin is showing the both of us around, being the real American of the group. I'll update this post later tonight!</p>
<p>We're in the car now, sorry if there's any typos, writing on my phone! We just picked up Lin from the airport and she's talking to Kevin from the back seat about some book they both enjoyed that I haven't read. I can't wait until I get to show her around!! If you have any good tips on where we should go, write it on my latest Instagram post where I asked the same thing! See ya!
<p>xo Jesse  </p>

   <p> Hey, guys. </p>
   <p>Oh my god...I think you all know what I'm going to write about this time. Hey guys, It's been a while. Sorry for that, but I'm sure you know why. It's all over the news after all...But if you don't: The disease from South America has spread. It's in the states. This is kind of scary now! People have been diagnosed down in the southern parts. Authorities are telling us to be wary of eating meat and recommends using vegetarian alternatives, but that we shouldn't worry. Some of my exchange student friends are going back to Sweden, but something tells me that they're overreacting. There's been sickness here before that's just been neurotic magazines getting off from anything supernatural-ish they can find. <p> But whooo cares what I think, though, right? Don't you think Kevin left the apartment without a word before the person on tv was even done talking about it?? 20 minutes later he returned with all of the canned food he collected for his hobby, his bug-out bag and his tool box. Of course... "Help me get the planks", he said and I told him to calm down, but he was so serious and I realized he wasn't giving this up. So now we're locked in and he says neither he, Lin or I can go outside.  I didn't know this was the kind of experience we were giving my best friend when she visited America for the first time...Oh well, this will probably calm down in a few days and by then so will probably Kevin.  </p>

   <h5>20th of August, 2022</h5> 
   <p> People are starting to disappear. It's made the news because so many are missing now. I hate to say it, but Kevin was right. This isn't something that can be handled, more and more videos are being spread from security cameras on the forums with people acting crazy. And they're increasing every. damn. day. The groups of those insane, aggressive humans sprinting after every human they can find only gets bigger and bigger. It scares me so much... <p>At first, it was just a single person or two seen running after someone in the videos, then it became larger groups. Now they're hordes, filling the streets like tsunamis, <em>tearing</em> people <em>apart</em>. Kevin and I are watching everything we can find on websites, forums and youtube. We have to find out everything we can about these things people are becoming. Anything we can scrap together from those horrifying clips. People have started spreading radio recordings too. But all you can hear from them are screams, things breaking or sometimes complete silence, except for the faint sound of fire and heavy, raspy breathing. We're losing contact with more states each day.  Lin called her mom yesterday. I could hear her devastated sobbing through the bathroom door. She just kept whispering...repeating: I want to go home, mom...I want to go home..., so many times. If things were different I would probably be offended tbh...but now I want to go home too. More than anything. </p> <p>Don't worry, we're on the third floor, so they won't get to us that easily. As I said in the last post - Kevin forced us to barricade the door a while back, but today we're barricading the windows to our balcony as well, even though they most likely couldn't reach it....we can't be sure. Do your best to stay safe and barricade, guys. Don't get out of town. They're not here yet, but it's too late at this point to leave. Too many are already trying, they'll be here before you make it to the highway.</p>

   <h5>2th of September, 2022</h5> 
   <p>Hard to type. Hands shaking very much. The ear-breaking alarm stopped more than three hours ago, but we're still sitting here, in the bathroom with the front door and balcony barricaded. Lights off. I don't think they're inside our apartment building yet, but we're staying here, waiting, for now. My watch is still working. If they aren't at our door in 5 hours, we're going outside of the bathroom to look through the window and see how bad it is down on the street. A part of me doesn't want to. It feels like they can smell us, sense us. Like if I took one step outside the bathroom they would know. I can't stand it....the screams, the roaring sound of thousands of people screaming is like a twisted version of a concert where it sounds like a roaring ocean of agonized cries. I can hear glass breaking, running. It sounds absolutely...insane. I can't even separate the screaming coming from those insane things and the screams of agony coming from the people anymore. My heart is in my throat, my head feels almost blank and even if we're on the third floor, even if they're probably not close enough to hear us in here...It feels like they would if I only moved an inch. The bathroom is pitch black, but I can still feel Lin's eyes on me.</p>
<p>She's sitting with her arms around my neck, eyes closed with our backs against the wall. The furthest away from the door. I can feel her shivering, or maybe it's me. Kevin is sitting by the door, listening, he brought a small axe in here for protection. Guns would be too loud. I brought a kitchen knife.  
I'll update if...no let's stay positive...when we go outside. I wish you all the best of luck.
Because I think you'll need it. </p>

  <h2 id = "saw">What we saw</h2>
   <h5>3th of September, 2022</h5> 
   <p>Hello. I'm losing my connection and I don't think it'll last for much longer. Still, I'm probably writing this for myself, mostly. I need to write it down. Grasp what the hell it was that we saw. Even with this going on, even with this whole damn experience, it was not what I expected. It was far worse.</p>

<p>Four hours after my last post, something strange happened. Despite the monsters not being here for more than 7-8 hours, the noise all just stopped. The screaming, the crashing, the quick footsteps of those insane people, madly sprinting across the streets. Everything was completely quiet, and it was incomprehensible to us. Kevin was looking at me, I nodded for response. You might think that it gave us hope, as if it could be that they already passed through our area and were gone, but while a part of my mind said so, the rest of it was telling me that something was wrong. Something was so, so wrong. I could tell that Kevin was thinking the same from the weak expression on his face. Like he was losing hope rather than gaining it. Something was strange about this. Despite only four hours passed, we decided to go outside. Lin stayed behind in the bathroom, too scared to move, and I whispered that she had to listen for strange noises from the door and come to us if she heard something. She nodded slowly.
Kevin unlocked the bathroom door, carefully, trying to make as little noise as possible. He slowly slid the door open and put out his head through the crack to look around before going outside. He made a gesture at me to come and held his axe, ready to use it if we had an uninvited guest that had gotten in, somehow. I stood up and as I left Lin she put her arms around her knees and rested her head on top.</p>

<p>The air in the living room was cold compared to the bathroom that only smelled of our anxious, warm sweat. Kevin walked in front of me with his axe, me with my kitchen knife that I gripped so hard that I could feel my knuckles turning white. I was trying to replace my fear with anger to make it more bearable, but it was nearly impossible. I had never been in a fight, never in a dangerous situation beyond the level of being pushed by a mean kid or swimming in the deeper area of a pool when too young. All I could feel was the pain in my chest. It felt like my heart was going to drop unless my body stayed as tense as it was. Like I'd choke on it. Tears formed in my eyes as the painful fear of what we were about to see clenched it's fist around my throat and made it hard to breathe. In our living room, we have two medium-sized windows, just about half a human tall on the wall. They give us a good view of the street, three stories down. We slowly walked up to the window, careful not to be seen. It had almost gotten dark outside and the sky was close to black. Our lights were off too, so we were standing in complete darkness as we saw the street for the first time in almost 10 hours. </p>

<p>We braced ourselves and looked out the window. Only to immediately cover our mouths to stop ourselves from coughing in surprise. They were <em>right there</em>. The insane things we'd only ever seen in videos, until now. Standing just outside our building. Hundreds of them. They were doing something strange with their bodies...rocking back and forth slowly with their hands close to their body like if scared. Hundreds of them, covering every centimetre of the street, just standing close together, growling, <em>waiting</em>. We stood there for minutes, just looking at them as our bodies got heavy. That's when Kevin said it. Just stating it like a fact that had always been there. "They're listening", he whispered. His words made my body feel like ice. That sudden awareness that they were listening <em> closely </em> to find us. Find me. I finally let the tears roll down my cheeks as I watched the monsters rocking bodies on the streets. There was no way we were getting out of here. If we made the smallest noise, the smallest sound that <em>just</em> happened to reach too far, they would storm the building...and we would be lost in seconds.  </p>

   <h5>10th of September, 2022</h5> 
   <p>It's like she knows something. Not sure what to do. I tried asking her but no success. I'm sitting in the living room, while they're talking about something I can't hear in the bathroom. Been 8 days since it started. No insane inside. yet. When I wrote about our first experience seeing the insane I started crying so I had to hide in the bathroom to muffle the sound. Something happened after we saw the insane. Something that made it worse. I couldn't tell you before due to taking that break to hide the sound of my sobbing, </p>
   
   <p>Looking out the window after we saw the insane, we suddenly heard a large bang. I quickly searched the area with my eyes for the source and saw someone across the street who shot at the insane. He looked like he was in his thirties and was wearing a cap. One monster fell to the ground before the entire neighborhood of insanes woke up all-together like the gunshot was a lightswitch and sprinted like if running for their life towards the apartment building where the man had been shooting. We saw him swearing as he saw the insanes coming towards him and shut the window. Only 30 seconds later, the window was covered with blood. We ran inside the bathroom to Lin, locked the door and stayed there for two days. </p>
   
   <p> We made the bathroom our base the next day. Storing our food in there, bathtub and sink filled with water before it was gone. Our bathroom is the place to return to when everything goes to shit. That's the closest we're getting to having a bunker, since it's the only door with any kind of lock. It feels as if not only Lin is hiding something from me, even Kevin seems to be awfully distant. It's as if they know something but won't tell me. I have to make them tell me. Leaving each other out of information that could be important and distancing ourselves from each other is what'll get us killed. Lin seems awfully angry at me lately too. She keeps judging me for keeping this blog going. I sort of see her point, but I think it's what's keeping me stable and not as sad. I need a reminder of what used to be to not lose my mind. In any other situation, she would understand that. She has always understood things. So what changed? A secret?
Lin is calling for me so I have to go. I need to find out what's going on. Wait- What was that soundslkdjslkad88887 </p>

   <h5>24th of September, 2022</h5>
        <p> So this is what she kept doing on her computer. I have no idea how she got the battery to last this long, especially with that long text about how we saw those...things for the first time. Even 22 days into the apocalypse she still couldn't keep herself from writing that romantically. It's me, Kevin. I'm writing here because...Jesse is gone. Not dead, just trapped in the apartment above us, surrounded by insanes in their identical bathroom. This isn't a video game. There isn't an AC that she can climb through or a hot romantic interest that's coming to save her. The only way that she can live is if <em> we</em> come to get her. And we will. But...If the truth ends up being that she doesn't return with us, or that the plan fails, I should probably at least tell you. Yeah, you who  finds this blog someday...maybe, what it was that me and Lin was keeping away from her. Because she was right. We were hiding something from her.  </p>
        <p>She is already one of them. </p>
